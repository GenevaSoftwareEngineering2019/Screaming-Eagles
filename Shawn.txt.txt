Michael Shawn Hickenbottom (born July 22, 1965), 
better known by his ring name Shawn Michaels,
 is an American actor, professional wrestling 
personality, television presenter and retired professional 
wrestler. He has been cited by a number of peers and viewers as 
the greatest in-ring performer in history.[8]

Currently signed to WWE as an ambassador and trainer since December 
2010, Michaels wrestled consistently for WWE, formerly the World Wrestling
 Federation (WWF), from 1988 until his first retirement in 1998. He held 
non-wrestling roles from 1998 to 2000 and resumed wrestling in 2002 until
 retiring ceremoniously in 2010.

In the WWF/WWE, Michaels headlined major pay-per-view events 
between 1989 and 2010, closing the company's flagship annual 
event, WrestleMania, five times. He was the co-founder and original
 leader of the successful stable, D-Generation X. Michaels also wrestled 
in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he founded The Midnight 
Rockers with Marty Jannetty in 1985. After winning the AWA World Tag Team 
Championship twice, the team continued to the WWF as The Rockers and had
 a high-profile breakup in January 1992. Within the year, Michaels twice 
challenged for the WWF Championship and won his first Intercontinental
 Championship, heralding his arrival as one of the industry's premier
 singles stars.Michaels is a four-time world champion, having held
 the WWF Championship three times and WWE's World Heavyweight
 Championship once. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble winner 
(and the first man to win the match as the number one entrant), 
the first WWF Grand Slam Champion and the fourth WWF Triple Crown
 Champion, as well as a WWE Hall of Fame class of 2011 inductee. Michaels
 won the Pro Wrestling Illustrated "Match of the Year" reader vote a record 
eleven times, and his match against John Cena on April 23, 2007 was ranked by
 WWE as the best match ever aired on the company's flagship Raw program
